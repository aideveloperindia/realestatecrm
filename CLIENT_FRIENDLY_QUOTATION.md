# Client-Friendly Quotation Guidelines

## Current Client Situation:
- 2 employees: ₹10,000 each = ₹20,000/month total
- Telecaller and Field Executive
- Need realistic, convincing pricing

## Key Points:
1. Remove internal cost breakdowns (engineering costs, etc.)
2. Focus on client benefits, not technical details
3. Show ROI based on their ₹20,000/month employee cost
4. No monthly maintenance - pay-per-change model (₹500 per change)
5. Use FREE tier platforms (keep costs low)
6. Make it convincing but not overwhelming

## Pricing Structure:
- One-time Development: Clear, simple price
- Platform fees: Mention FREE tier available
- Maintenance: Pay-per-change at ₹500 per 1-day work change
- No monthly subscription for maintenance
